Question 1:

mystery_t should be uintptr_t as it points to a virtual address.
We know that it points to a virtual address because it is set to the
value of the pointer "value" which is dereferenced in the third line.
That would make no sense if it were a physical address, since all address
translation starts with virtual addresses.
