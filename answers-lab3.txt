Problem 1:
The feature that we get with individual handler functions is being able to 
retrieve the trap number and have a common handling function trap() for all
traps.
The processor does not pass any information about which interrupt number 
triggered calling the handler. By having a different handler for each one, 
we can hard-code the values and place them in a location so that we can
have a common handler function that switches on that value.

Problem 2:
Nothing special needed to be done other than having a handler for interrupts
13 and 14.
Calling int $14 is disallowed at CPL 3 since the DPL for gate 14 is 0.
This generates a general protection fault, which uses gate 13.
If the kernel allowed int $14 to work, then user programs could trigger
arbitrary page faults and potentially destabilize the system.
