Question 1:
I created a syscall called SYS_net_send_packet which takes an address
and a length of the packet stored at that address.
Internally, this copies the packet out of userspace into a temp buffer
in the kernel and calls my e1000_send_packet function on that buffer (which
is page_aligned).
If the ring is full, I loop on the DD status bit being clear. When it is
set the function completes the transmit and returns.
